										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN)As the daughter of Diana Ross, Tracee Ellis Ross&#8217; portrayal of a pop diva adds an appealing hook to &#8220;The High Note,&#8221; which casts her as an aging songstress whose career has reached a crossroads. Despite a fairly generic tune, the movie comes together harmoniously enough, augmented in part by characters motivated and connected by their passion for music.</p>
<p>After the &#8220;Fifty Shades&#8221; trilogy, Dakota Johnson exhibits a more flattering new shade as Maggie, the harried assistant to Ross&#8217; superstar Grace Davis. Introduced zipping in from Maui via private jet, Grace faces a high-class problem, as her manager (Ice Cube) pushes her toward a Las Vegas residency, which strikes Grace as creative purgatory.<br />
Maggie, a longtime fan with insights into the music biz that are eventually explained, yearns to be a producer, and keeps overstepping her place on the org chart. Specifically, she gently prods Grace to maintain her artistic integrity, reminding the star of her own quote, &#8220;When there are no more surprises, then who am I doing it for?&#8221;<br />
During her rare down time, Maggie also meets a talented singer, David (Kelvin Harrison Jr., coming off a big year with &#8220;Waves&#8221; and &#8220;Luce&#8221;), becoming involved in his career as well. There&#8217;s a &#8220;Working Girl&#8221;-type quality as she races between the two &#8212; juggling producing and grunt work, seemingly against all odds &#8212; complicated by the chemistry that she and David possess.<br />
&#8220;The High Note&#8221; employs a pretty conventional story and songbook, including a view of the music industry that doesn&#8217;t venture far from &#8220;A Star is Born.&#8221; The same goes for the L.A. locations and glamor.<br />

The trip feels a little bumpy at first, as the movie somewhat awkwardly proceeds along those parallel tracks. Yet as directed by Nisha Ganatra (&#8220;Late Night&#8221;), the story possesses enough heft to pull the audience along, and manages to find humanity in Grace despite her privileged existence.<br />
Credit much of that to Ross &#8212; as the &#8220;Black-ish&#8221; star reverses mom&#8217;s path from concert stage to screen, making her musical debut by ably doing her own singing &#8212; creating a relatable image of fading stardom. In what amounts to a team-up of performers with famous parents, Johnson also believably plays Maggie as someone whose appreciation of music drives her professionally, while becoming the foundation of her relationship with David.<br />
The lady doesn&#8217;t sing the blues, but in addition to original songs the soundtrack features plenty of classics, such as Harrison crooning &#8220;You Send Me&#8221; and &#8220;Let&#8217;s Stay Together.&#8221; There are also cameos by Bill Pullman and Eddie Izzard in tiny but significant roles.<br />
Practically speaking, the film joins the roster of movies whose theatrical debut was scuttled by coronavirus that likely would have struggled to make much box-office noise anyway.<br />
Somewhat spared that pressure, &#8220;The High Note&#8221; is a breezy way to kill a few hours. Granted, it&#8217;s more an opening act than a headliner, but that simply makes its digital, on-demand residency feel like the venue where the film rightfully belongs.</p>
